Hey, I'm Engjell. I'm a self taught full stack web developer with over two years of experience. I'm passionate about software and always investing time into learning new technology.

This is a small task created for Reckless Agency. It's a user management system with an admin panel on which you can create an account and manage users depending on the roles you have. I have spent around 5 hours on this project and would add more features if I was required to. I was planning on adding features like checking if role X has permission X to edit/view Y tab and stuff like user-created posts, user panel etc.

A list of some of the features the project currently has are:

- Account creation/login using Laravel Breeze.
- User roles and permissions.
- Admin panel which allows you to manage and delete users.
- An artisan command to view all roles (php artisan list:roles)
- User search
- Restricted routes for authenticated users and administrators.
